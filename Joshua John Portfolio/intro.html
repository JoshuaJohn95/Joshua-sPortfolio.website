            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My Professional journey begins after graduating my Bachelor's, got sceptical on choosing jobs. Then one of my friend approached me to join his placement agency called The Job Shop Pvt Ltd. So i worked there as a Recruter. After working for years, find the job more monotonous and less interesting. This leads me to shift my career and joined CogMat Digital as a ORM Associate. During those working days, i've collaberated with graphic designers to improve the brand content and while seeing their creative thinking regarding designs helped me find a new passion in designing. So i decided to leave the company to follow my passion, completed a Web Designing Certification Course from IT Vedant and since then i work as a Freelance Web Designer.</p><br>
